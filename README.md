# BlockConnectorServer
This program will listen to port 6178 and display a HTML page that allow the
user to configure blocks with output and input and save the configuration to
a _json_ file in the server.

This program was made primarily to be used only for localhost, the resulting
_json_ file is meant to be used for another program that may use blocks to
configure a procedure.

Tested with 'Firefox 67.0.1' and 'node v11.15.0' on Linux(4.19.49-1-MANJARO).
